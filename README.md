# Dynamic Array Dart

This is simple project of implementation dynamic array using Dart. \
Main mechanism of dynamic array is dynamically expand its size with some coefficient, in this program it is 200% coefficient.

Experiment was done by adding 100K elements to the array and the result is:
``` 
Index is: 568. Bad time: 0.001 seconds
Index is: 3065. Bad time: 0.003 seconds

Worst index: 3065. Bad time: 0.003 seconds
All time is: 100.18 seconds

Current size is: 100000
Max size is: 131072
```

Also it allows you to:
- Get an element
- Set an element on the index
- Print information about the array
- Sort it with bubblesort passing comparator function
- Clear the array by removing all the elements and reset dynamic array to its start state
